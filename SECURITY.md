# Security

This repository contains the public documentation site for UnisonOS.

For overall security, privacy, and deployment guidance (including wake-word, “always-on”, and edge-first behavior), see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security or privacy issue described in the documentation, or a problem with how security guidance is presented, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
