# Vision & Value

Unison exists to put intelligence back on the edge.

Most AI experiences today are rented from remote clouds: opaque, centralized, and difficult to shape to the needs of a single person or organization. Unison takes the opposite approach. It runs on your hardware, speaks to your sensors, and treats the cloud as an optional extension rather than a requirement.

At the heart of Unison is an intent orchestration plane that coordinates services for identity, consent, context, storage, and inference. An agent never acts in isolation; every action flows through clear contracts, policy checks, and auditable decisions. The result is an agentic platform that is powerful, but never mysterious.

## Core Value Pillars

- **Edge-first autonomy** – Unison is designed to run on real hardware (PCs, edge servers, future devices) with local models and storage so agents can keep working even when disconnected.
- **Privacy and consent-by-design** – High-impact actions require explicit confirmation and logging. Policy and consent services make decisions visible and traceable.
- **Secure edge profiles** – Context graph, context store, and storage combine into a secure profile that is under user control, with optional sync or backup when explicitly allowed.
- **Unified orchestration** – A single orchestrator coordinates services for identity, policy, consent, context, storage, and inference instead of scattering logic across clients.
- **Inclusive experience** – Accessibility and modality awareness are treated as core requirements, not afterthoughts.

## Why Now

Devices are more capable than ever, but most AI assistance is still centralized. That creates privacy risk, latency, and a disconnect between what users want and what centralized systems permit.

Unison offers a different path: keep intelligence close to the person, structure it around explicit contracts and consent, and give developers a coherent way to build and deploy agentic experiences across fleets of devices.
