# Vision & Value

## A New Relationship With Technology

UnisonOS imagines a world where every person directs the objectives of their own AI, free from competing incentives or unwanted interference. It’s a computing experience shaped entirely around what you want to accomplish, expressed through natural interaction rather than commands, menus, or learned behavior.

UnisonOS creates an environment where technology adapts to the person, not the other way around. Interactions happen the way humans naturally think and communicate, through intent, context, and multimodal expression, without requiring anyone to interact directly with technical structures like apps, files, or workflows.

## A Platform Built Around You

UnisonOS is an Operating Surface that hosts and orchestrates your preferred AI models (local or cloud-based) under clear policies you control. Your context, history, and preferences evolve outside of any model, so nothing personal is shared by default and switching models never means losing your continuity.

By keeping intelligence close to the person and separating personal data from model memory, UnisonOS supports deeply personalized experiences that remain private, portable, and aligned with your needs.

## Core Value Pillars

### Personalized intelligence

UnisonOS learns your preferences, routines, and patterns while keeping all context under your control. Experiences are composed specifically for you and evolve as you evolve.

### Your AI, your objectives

Every model acts according to the objectives you set. There are no competing priorities, no advertising incentives, and no hidden agenda, just technology working on your behalf.

### Privacy and consent by design

Actions follow clear rules, policies, and consent flows. What you share and when you share it are always explicit decisions, not assumptions.

### Platform-level orchestration

Identity, policy, consent, context, storage, and inference are coordinated through a unified orchestration layer, creating reliable, predictable behavior across devices and models.

### Inclusive from the start

Multimodal, accessibility-first design ensures UnisonOS adapts naturally to different abilities, environments, and ways of interacting.

## Why Now

Devices at the edge have become powerful enough to support meaningful local intelligence. At the same time, people increasingly want AI experiences that reflect their needs and not the priorities of third-parties.

UnisonOS brings these trends together. It keeps intelligence close to the person, maintains privacy by default, integrates local and cloud models through a consistent policy layer, and enables developers to build new kinds of experiences centered on intent, context, and trust.
