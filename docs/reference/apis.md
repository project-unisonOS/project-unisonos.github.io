# APIs

Each core Unison service exposes an HTTP API, typically documented by its README and OpenAPI UI.

## Service Index

- Control plane services (orchestrator, intent-graph, policy, consent, auth, inference).
- Context and storage services.
- Experience and IO services (renderer, shell, agent-vdi, io-core, io-speech, io-vision).

## API Documentation

- Look for API sections in each service’s README.
- Where available, use the service’s built-in API documentation endpoints when running locally or in devstack.

As the APIs stabilize and converge on consistent conventions, this page can be expanded into a more detailed, cross-service reference.
