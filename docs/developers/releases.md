# Releases (Developer Images)

UnisonOS platform images are delivered as **GitHub Release assets** from the `unison-platform` repository (not GHCR).

These images are intended for developers who want a fast install path for one of:

- Windows + WSL2
- Linux VM
- Bare metal

## What to download

Each release is **target-specific** (WSL2 OR VM OR bare metal). The release notes will state who it’s for and which single asset to download.

## Install instructions

Use the canonical install page (don’t rely on copy/pasted commands from old release notes):

- [Install UnisonOS developer images](https://project-unisonos.github.io/unison-platform/install)
