# Get Started with Unison

The fastest way to work with Unison is to run the devstack on a WSL2 or Linux machine and iterate against real services.

## What You Will Do

1. Install prerequisites (WSL2 or Linux, Docker Desktop, Python, Node).
2. Clone the Unison workspace (recommended) or the core repos side-by-side.
3. Set up Python virtual environments using the shared constraints file.
4. Start the devstack using workspace scripts (or Compose directly).
5. Run the renderer and/or shell against the running stack.
6. Run unit tests and end-to-end smoke tests.
7. Create a feature branch, make changes, and open a pull request.
