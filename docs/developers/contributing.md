# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving Unison.

## Branching Model

- `main` – Stable, production-ready branch.
- `dev` – Active development and integration branch.
- `feature/*` or `fix/*` – Short-lived branches for specific changes.

## Workflow Summary

1. Fork the target repository and create a feature branch from `dev`.
2. Make your changes and update tests and documentation.
3. Run local tests and relevant devstack or smoke tests.
4. Commit using clear, imperative messages.
5. Push your branch and open a pull request against `dev`.
