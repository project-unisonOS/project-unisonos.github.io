# Roadmap and DX Focus

This page highlights high-level roadmap themes and developer experience (DX) priorities. For up-to-date details, consult the organization’s issue trackers and project boards.

## Near-Term Focus

- Clarifying and harmonizing environment variables and `.env.example` files across services.
- Improving onboarding paths and devstack documentation.
- Aligning internal docs and specs with the actual code and configurations.

## Medium-Term Focus

- Standardizing observability defaults across services.
- Publishing clearer profiles for different deployment targets (edge devices, development machines, optional GPU use).
- Evolving the architecture docs as new capabilities land.

## Where to Track Progress

- GitHub issues and project boards in the `project-unisonOS` organization.
- Internal DX and documentation cleanup plans in the workspace docs.
