# Governance

Unison is maintained as a set of repositories under the `project-unisonOS` organization, with shared expectations for releases, coordination, and behavior.

## Maintainers

- Each repo has one or more maintainers responsible for:
  - Reviewing and merging pull requests.
  - Coordinating releases.
  - Keeping documentation in sync with behavior.

## Versioning and Releases

- Semantic versioning across repos (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Tagged releases are created from stable branches.
- Cross-repo changes are coordinated to keep the stack compatible and devstack healthy.

## Community Standards

- Collaboration follows a Code of Conduct and contribution guidelines.
- Accessibility, documentation quality, and security are treated as shared responsibilities.

For detailed policies, see the internal MAINTAINERS, CONTRIBUTING, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT documents.
